The 2nd Insights in Data FAIRification Planning tutorial is dedicated to supporting people on the crucial _“identifying your FAIRification objectives”_ step of FAIRification.

This tutorial focuses on providing practical guidance on effectively planning the FAIRification process via the [GO-Plan method](https://er2023.inesc-id.pt/wp-content/uploads/forum_paper_2142.pdf){:target="_blank"}, summarised in the Figure below. It also showcases the benefits of generating data that adheres to the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR). 

This tutorial is based on the formats of previous [Bring Your Own Data Workshops](https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article/doi/10.1162/dint_a_00236/118045/Building-expertise-on-FAIR-through-evolving-Bring){:target="_blank"}, which focus on the FAIRification process. 

The first edition of this tutorial has been organised as a [workshop at EDOC 2023](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/conf/edoc-2023/workshops/){:target="_blank"}.
