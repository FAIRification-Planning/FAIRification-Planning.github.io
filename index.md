The Bring Your Own FAIRification Objectives workshop – BYOFO Workshop - is dedicated to supporting people on the crucial _“identifying your FAIRification objectives”_ step of FAIRification.

The workshop is organised following a “Bring Your Own Data” – [BYOD](about:blank) – format, where participants learn from “try and fail” hands-on exercises. It is intended for those who want to learn more about preparing and planning for FAIRification.

The one-day BYOFO workshop is organised at the [Enterprise Design, Operations and Computing (EDOC 2023) Conference](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/conf/edoc-2023/call-for-papers/).
