The Bring Your Own FAIRification Objectives workshop – BYOFO Workshop - is dedicated to supporting people on the crucial _“identifying your FAIRification objectives”_ step of FAIRification.

The workshop is organised following a “Bring Your Own Data” – BYOD – format (e.g., [RD BYOD](https://www.ejprarediseases.org/?s=bring+your+own+data)), where participants learn from “try and fail” hands-on exercises. It is intended for those who want to learn more about preparing and planning for FAIRification.

The BYOFO workshop is organised at the [Enterprise Design, Operations and Computing (EDOC 2023) Conference](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/conf/edoc-2023/call-for-papers/), which will take place from **October 30 to November 3, 2023**, in Groningen, the Netherlands.

### Motivation

The process of making data FAIR ('FAIRification') is multifaceted and multidisciplinary, and it can be accomplished through a variety of means. As a result, defining explicit FAIRification objectives at the onset of the process is critical to ensuring successful and efficient FAIRification. These objectives serve as a guide for the subsequent FAIRification implementation decisions, assisting in the establishment of a cohesive and effective FAIRification process. 

To the best of our knowledge, limited research has been conducted on effective methods for eliciting FAIRification objectives and their impact on FAIRification activities. Considering these gaps in knowledge, we proposed a goal-based FAIRification planning [method](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7778372) that builds on experience gained from recent FAIRification projects and feedback from experts on FAIR. It provides a systematic approach to identifying, refining and prioritizing FAIRification objectives. The method consists of six phases that focus on important aspects of FAIRification: 
* (i) FAIRification preparation, 
* (ii) assessment of FAIR supporting infrastructure and target resources, 
* (iii) preparation of project stakeholders, 
* (iv) identification of domain scope and groups of reuse stakeholders, 
* (v) FAIRification goals refinement and alignment to target FAIR principles,
* (vi) decision-making.

In the proposed workshop, we aim at instructing people on using the method for planning FAIRification projects. We seek to raise awareness of the benefits of proper planning before the FAIRification project execution and to provide instruction on best practices for doing so.
