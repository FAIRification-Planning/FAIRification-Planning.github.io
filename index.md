The Bring Your Own FAIRification Objectives workshop – BYOFO Workshop - is dedicated to supporting people on the crucial _“identifying your FAIRification objectives”_ step of FAIRification.

The workshop is organised following a “Bring Your Own Data” – [BYOD](about:blank){:target="_blank"} – format, where participants learn from “try and fail” hands-on exercises. It is intended for those who want to learn more about preparing and planning for FAIRification.
