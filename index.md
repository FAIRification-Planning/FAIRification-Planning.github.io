The Bring Your Own FAIRification Objectives workshop – BYOFO Workshop - is dedicated to supporting people on the crucial _“identifying your FAIRification objectives”_ step of FAIRification.

The workshop is organised following a “Bring Your Own Data” – [BYOD](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8247728){:target="_blank"} – format, where participants learn from hands-on exercises. It is intended for those who want to learn more about preparing and planning for FAIRification.

The half-day workshop will take place at the [Enterprise Design, Operations and Computing (**EDOC 2023**) Conference](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/conf/edoc-2023/call-for-papers/){:target="_blank"}.
